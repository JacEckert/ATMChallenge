# ATMChallenge
A simple ATM coding challenge


### PIN:
four digit numeric code for identification


### MENU:
Each menu item can be reached in three ways:
- by index (1, 2, 3)
- by keyword (balance, deposit, withdraw)
- by text (show balance, make a deposit, make a withdrawal)


### DEPOSIT/WITHDRAW:
input must be a non-negative decimal number


### TO QUIT:
complete any in-progress transactions by submitting a valid number (zero will always work), and type 'DONE'

this will terminate the program and delete your account, so enjoy your temporary riches while you can
