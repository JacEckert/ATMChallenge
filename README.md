# ATMChallenge
A simple ATM coding challenge

## To Run
Simple and straightforward: download both ATM.java and Account.java and place them in the same folder, then compile ATM.java and run it

As this was developed, run, and tested, unfortunately on an old Windows system, console commands 'javac ATM.java' and 'java ATM' are the tried and true methods so far


### PIN
A four digit numeric code for identification


### MENU
Each menu item can be reached in three ways:
- by index (1, 2, 3)
- by keyword (balance, deposit, withdraw)
- by text (show balance, make a deposit, make a withdrawal)


### DEPOSIT/WITHDRAW
Input must be a non-negative decimal number


### TO QUIT
Complete any in-progress transactions by submitting a valid number (zero will always work), and type 'DONE'

This will terminate the program and delete your account, so enjoy your temporary riches while you can
